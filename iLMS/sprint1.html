          In this sprint, the goal was to come up with design ideas which will be implemented in the further sprints. In order to achieve this, Google Design Sprint Kit was used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Google Design Sprint Kit divides the designing process into six phases, namely,
          <ol>
            <li> Understand </li>
            <li> Define </li>
            <li> Sketch </li>
            <li> Decide </li>
            <li> Prototype </li>
            <li> Validate </li>
          </ol>

        <h4> Understand Phase </h4>
        <h5> Methodology Used: User Interviews and User Journey Mapping</h5>
        <p>
          In order to conduct user interviews, we identified two kinds of users, i.e., students and mentors.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the students, we asked questions regarding the issues which they face while taking quizzes in the current version of lms. We also asked them about what types of test would they want to see and what are suggestions they have for the assessment user-interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the mentors, we asked how the current version worked for adding quizzes and what do they think will simplify the process for them. We also asked about the types of questions which the recommend for the assessment and what should be the rules for the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the interviews, we formulated the user journey maps for both mentors and students.

              <img src="img/sprint1/user-journey-student.jpg" alt="" width="75%">
              <figcaption>
                User Journey Map - Students
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>
        </p>

        <h4> Define Phase </h4>
        <h5> Methodology Used: Golden Path</h5>
        <p>
          Since, there was no existing assessment building system, we decided to focus on creating the golden path for that purpose only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the user journey and team discussion, we came up with this golden path:
          <center>

              <img src="img/sprint1/golden-path.jpg" alt="" width="75%">

            </figure>
          </center>
        </p>

        <h4> Sketch Phase </h4>
        <h5> Methodology Used: Crazy 8</h5>
        <p>
          Each member of the team created the rough sketches of 8 screens to show their ideas. Based on all the  sketched, a final sketch was made
          <center>
            <figure>
              <img src="img/sprint1/sketches.jpeg" alt="" width="75%">
              <figcaption>
                Solution Sketches
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>
        </p>

        <h4> Decide Phase </h4>
        <h5> Methodology Used: Present Solution Sketches</h5>
        <p>
          The solution sketches made in the Sketch Phase were presented in front of the other teams, mentor and Product Owner to get their opinions. Based of their comments and ideas, the sketches were updated
          <center>

                Final Sketches
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>
        </p>

        <h4> Prototype Phase </h4>
        <h5> Methodology Used: Prototyping Tools </h5>
        <p>
          Based on the final sketches, a prototype was made in order to understand the navigation between the pages and to have a big picture of how our website will look like. This was done using the prototyping tool 'Just in Mind'.
        </p>

        <h4> Validate Phase </h4>
        <p>
          Since, the prototypes designed by all the teams came up to be low-fidelity, it was decided to skip the validate phase and go to the overall implementation of the project. The validation will be done for the main project itself rather than the prototype.
