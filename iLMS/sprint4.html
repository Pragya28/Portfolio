          In this sprint, the main aim was to fix the bugs identified in the work done in the previous sprints. We also wanted to complete the evaluation of fill up questions.

            We wanted to start with the evaluation of coding questions in the next sprint. So I concentrated on getting the code written by the user on the editor and storing it in a json file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with that, I studied a little about Tango API, which we planned to use for code evaluation.

            In this sprint, we were not able to complete much of the task. We were able to clear the input boxes for the next question. However, there were still problems in handling submission if someone submits same question multiple times, so evaluation was not completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also faced a blocker in the form of lack of information on the availability and url of Tango API, we disrupted our plans for next sprint.
