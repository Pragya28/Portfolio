            In this sprint, one user-story was carried forward from the previous sprint and one new user-story was added to the backlog. These were:
            <ol>
              <li> As a student, I should be able to start the assessment to see the first question, so that I can read the question and answer it. (Continued from sprint 2) </li>
              <li> As a student, I should be able to see the result of my assessment after I finish, so that I can move on to the next learning objective. </li>

            Since I was working with the code editor part in the previous sprint, in this sprint I was asked to change the supporting library to the latest version of codemirror, i.e., CodeMirror 6. Using the latest version proved to be better as this library already had a basic setup so I didn't had to select which each and every feature which I want in my editor. Moreover, I was able to style the editor according to my wishes rather than using a fixed theme.

          <p>
            I also had the responsiblity to integrate the editor with the questions page and style it. I also had to make sure that the design of the editor was responsive.

            In this sprint, we were able to complete all the user-stories as planned. However, few bugs were identified whose resolution will be done in the next sprint.
