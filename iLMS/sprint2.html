            In this sprint, actual development of the project started. The target of this sprint was to create the user-interface for students to attempt an assessment based on the user-stories selected from the Product Backlog.

              Three user-stories were selected for implementation in this sprint. These were:
              <ol>
                  <li> As a student, I should be able to click on the assessment to see the instructions, so that I know what to expect in the assessment. </li>
                  <li> As a student, I should be able to start the assessment to see the first question, so that I can read the question and answer it. </li>
                  <li> As a student, I should be able to click on the next question, so that I can see the next question or finish the assessment in case it is the last question. </li>

              Based on previous sprint, it was decided that we will have two types of assessment questions: fill in the blanks (code-based to avoid the problems which can arise in auto-evaluation because of case, spaces, etc) and coding questions.
          </p>
          <p>
              I took the responsiblity of making the user-interface for the code-editor such that it is able to recognize and highlight the syntax based to the programming language being used. For this purpose, I used the library in Javascript called codemirror.

              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </center>
          <p>
            The above figure shows the code editor which I designed using codemirror version 5.6.11. This editor is able to highlight the syntax for a number of programming languages. However, it is currently configured for Python.

              By the end of this sprint, we were able to complete the first and third user-stories, i.e, we were able to show an instructions page after clicking on start assessment and were able to navigate to the next question.
          </p>
          <p>
              With respect to second user-story, the basic template for importing the question from a json file was done for both fill ups and coding questions, however, integration of that part with the page on which questions will be displayed was left and carried forward to next sprint.
